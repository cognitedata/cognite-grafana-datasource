[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) datasource for [Cognite Data Fusion](https://cognite.com/).

---

## Features

- Easily create graphs with timeseries from Cognite Data Fusion
- Perform custom queries to filter for specific timeseries
- Use variables to create templated dashboards
- Add event annotations to graphs
- Apply custom functions to timeseries

## Installation

#### Via Grafana Plugin Store

The easiest way to install this plugin is to go to [https://grafana.com/plugins/cognitedata-datasource/installation](https://grafana.com/plugins/cognitedata-datasource/installation), and follow the installation instructions there.

#### Docker

The official image is hosted on Docker Hub as
[cognite/grafana-cdf](https://hub.docker.com/r/cognite/grafana-cdf/)

To run it, first create a Docker volume to store your dashboards
and settings.

`docker volume create grafana-storage`

Run the Docker image using this volume:

`docker run -d --name grafana -p 3000:3000 -v grafana-storage:/var/lib/grafana cognite/grafana-cdf`

Now you can access Grafana at http://localhost:3000

Standard username/password for logging in is admin/admin. See
[http://docs.grafana.org/installation/docker/](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/docker/) for configuration details.

For more help with Docker, see the [step-by-step guide](./instructions.md).

## Adding the Data Source

To set up CDF, do the following:

- Go to `Configuration` click `Data Sources`, then `Add data source`, and choose `Cognite Data Fusion`.
- Give the data source a name, provide the name of the project and your API key.
- Hit `Save & Test`

![Configuring Data Source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cognitedata/cognite-grafana-datasource/docs/dashboard-development/images/readme/image1.png)

You're now ready to start using the datasource!

To make a chart, click on the plus sign on the left sidebar and select `Dashboard` here. Click on `Add panel` do add a new chart.
You need to specify datasource for the chart. To do this, select one of the available datasources from the dropdown list below chart.

By default, it refers to default datasource in Grafana instance.   

## Usage

There are three ways to get timeseries into Grafana:

#### Select Timeseries

If you only want to see the data from one specific timeseries.

- Simply start typing the name of the desired timeseries and then select it from the dropdown list.
- Aggregation and granularity can be specified using corresponding fields (by default aggregation set to `average` and granularity calculated based on the time interval displayed)
- You can also set a custom label and use the format `{{property}}` to pull data from the timeseries. E.g. `{{name}} - {{description}}`

#### Select Timeseries from Asset

If you want to get a few timeseries associated with an asset

- Choose an asset to pull timeseries associated with it. `Include Subassets` switcher can be used to get timeseries related to subassets.
- Aggregation, granularity, and labels can be modified in the same way as in  `Timeseries` tab.

#### Custom Query

If you want more fine-grained control on timeseries fetching. This tab allows timeseries combination (arithmetic operations, special functions, etc.). Synthetic timeseries (STS) have special syntax described below.

**Define query**

To request timeseries you should specify a query with the parameters inside, for instance:
```
ts{id=123}
```
Query above requests for the timeseries using `id` equals `123`. You can request timeseries with `id`, `externalId` or timeseries filters, which you can find in 
[CDF documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/listTimeSeries). 

![Custom Query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cognitedata/cognite-grafana-datasource/docs/dashboard-development/images/readme/image4.png)

There are several property types that can be specified with STS:

- `string` or `number`: `ts{id=123}` or `ts{externalId="external_123"}`
- `array`: `ts{assetIds=[123, 456]}`
- `object`: `ts{metadata={key1="value1", key2="value2"}}`

To create complex STS you might need a combination of types above in a single query:
```
ts{name="test", assetSubtreeIds=[{id=123}, {externalId="external_123"}]}
```

**Filtering**

Synthetic timeseries (STS) query also supports filtering based on timeseries properties which apply as logical `AND`. For instance,
if you want to filter timeseries which: 
- belongs to asset with `id` equals `123`
- `name` starts with `"Begin"`
- `name` doesn't end with `"end"`
- `name` doesn't equal `"Begin query"`

query should be:
```
ts{assetIds=[123], name=~"Begin.*", name!~".*end", name!="Begin query"}
```

As you might notice, the query above contains 4 types of equality:
- `=` - strict equality. It's used to specify parameters for timeseries request to CDF
- `=!` - strict inequality. It's used to filter fetched timeseries by the property, which doesn't equal to the provided string
- `=~` – regexp equality. It's used to filter fetched timeseries by the property, that matches provided regexp
- `!~` - regexp inequality. It's used to filter fetched timeseries by the property, that doesn't match provided regexp

It can be used even for metadata filtering:
```
ts{externalIdPrefix="test", metadata={key1="value1", key2=~"value2.*"}}
```
Query above requests for the timeseries with:
- `externalIdPrefix` equals `"test"`
- `metadata.key1` equals `"value1"`
- `metadata.key2` starts with `"value2"`

**Aggregation and granularity**

Aggregation and granularity can be specified for each timeseries using corresponded dropdowns in UI. Default values for them are the same as in previous tabs.
Let's assume, that aggregation is set to `average` and granularity equals `1h`. Then all queries in the tab request datapoints with the selected aggregation and granularity.

But STS query syntax allows us to define aggregation and granularity to each timeseries separately:
```
ts{name="test", aggregate="interpolation", granularity="30m"}
```
Query above overrides values of aggregation and granularity which is set in UI

**Arithmetic operations**

You're also allowed to apply arithmetic operations for timeseries to combine them. For instance:
```
ts{id=123} + ts{externalId="test"}
```
Result of the query above is a single plot where datapoints are summed values of each timeseries. Another example:
```
ts{name~="test1.*"} + ts{id=123}
```
This is another situation, where query `ts{name~="test1.*"}` can return more than 1 timeseries, but let's assume that it returns 3 timeseries with ids `111`, `222` and `333`.
Then, the result of the query above is 3 plots, which are a combination of summed timeseries values returned by first and second expression in the query. Result plots actually represent queries below:
- `ts{id=111} + ts{id=123}`
- `ts{id=222} + ts{id=123}`
- `ts{id=333} + ts{id=123}`

**Functions**
STS supports a bunch of functions, that can be applied on timeseries:
- trigonometric: `sin(ts{})`, `cos(ts{})`, `pi()`
- variable-length functions: `max(ts{}, ...)`, `min(ts{}, ...)`, `avg(ts{}, ...)`    
- algebraic: `ln(ts{})`, `pow(ts{}, exponent)`, `sqrt(ts{})`, `exp(ts{})`, `abs(ts{})`   
- `on_error(ts{}, default)` – for handling errors like overflow or division by zero
- `map(expression, [list of strings to map from], [list of values to map to], default)` - function, that allows tto work with string timeseries

`on_error()` function allows chart rendering even if some exception appears. It handles errors like:
- `BAD_DOMAIN` - If bad input ranges are provided. E.g. division by zero, or sqrt of negative number
- `OVERFLOW` - If result is more than 10^100 in absolute value
If any of these are encountered, instead of returning a value for that timestamp, CDF returns an error field with an error message.
To avoid these, you can wrap the (sub)expression in the on_error() function:
```
on_error(1/TS{externalId='canBeZero'}, 0)
```

`map()` function can handle timeseries with string values, i.e. converts strings to doubles. 
As an example, assume that the time series "stringstate" can have values `"OPEN"` or `"CLOSED"`. Then you can convert it to a number with:
```
map(TS{externalId='stringstate'}, ['OPEN', 'CLOSED'], [1, 0], -1)
```
`"OPEN"` is mapped to 1, `"CLOSED"` to 0, and everything else to -1

<!-- todo: link has to updated after STS release -->
List of available functions can be found in [CDF documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/api/playground/#section/Functions)

Aggregates on string timeseries is not supported right now, not even interpolation. All string time series are considered step timeseries

## Templating / Variables

In order to perform templating, we enable the use of variables via `$variable` or `[[variable]]` syntax.

- To add variables, go to your dashboard's settings, and then select `Variables` from the left side.
- Make sure the `Type` is set to `Query`, and then set your Cognite Data Source as the `Data Source`.
- You can then specify the query to pull assets from CDF, and also filter on these assets. For instance:
```
assets{parentIds=[123], name=~"test-.*"}
```
Query above requests for assets with parameter `parentIds=[123]` and filter results by `name` matches `test-.*` regexp

Full list of params is available in [CDF documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/listAssets) 

![Variable Query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cognitedata/cognite-grafana-datasource/docs/dashboard-development/images/readme/image5.png)

![Variable as root asset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cognitedata/cognite-grafana-datasource/docs/dashboard-development/images/readme/image6.png)

Variables can be also formatted in a way to fit it into the query, for instance in the case when you have a multivalue variable:
```
ts{assetIds=[${variable:csv}]}
```
Variable will be serialized to comma-separated value in case if few assets will be selected from the dropdown.
More about variables formatting in Grafana you can find in [Grafana Docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/advanced-variable-format-options/) 

## Annotations / Events

Events from CDF can also be shown in Grafana via annotations.

- To add annotations, go to your dashboard's settings, and then select `Annotations` from the left side.
- Choose your Cognite Data Source as the `Data Source`.
- You can then specify the query to pull events from CDF and filter on these events. For instance:
```
events{type="some", subtype=~"sub.*"}
```
Query above requests for events with parameter `type="some"` and filter results by `subtype` matches `test-.*` regexp

Full list of params is available in [CDF documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/listAssets)
