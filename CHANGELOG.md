# Releases

This article documents the ongoing improvements we're making to the **Cognite Data Source for Grafana**.

## 2.5.0 - June 1, 2022

### Relationships support

- The connector now supports the CDF relationships resource type. Read more about relationships at [Relationships documentation](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/concepts/resource_types/relationships).
- With relationships support you can now fetch time series based on relationships in the "Time series from asset" tab. Relationships can be filtered on data set, labels and active relationships based on the time filter selected in Grafana.
- A new relationships tab has been added which can be used to utilize Grafana's Node Graph visualization plugin, or a new (alpha) custom visualization plugin which can be found at [cognite-grafana-relationships-visualization](https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-grafana-relationships-visualization)

### Templates support (preview)

- A new templates tab has been added which support the CDF templates feature (preview). Enable this in the data source settings.
- Using templates with Grafana will allow you to dynamically scale your dashboards when adding equipment.
- Documentation: https://docs.cognite.com/dev/concepts/resource_types/templates


## 2.4.0 - August 20, 2021

### Features

- OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow to authenticate and authorize against CDF.

## 2.3.0 - June 1, 2021

### Features

- Ability to link variables so that the value of one variable can be used as an input to another.


## 2.2.0 - April 6, 2021

### Features

- Tabular representation of events data.
- Event annotation query shows unfinished events by default.
- Support for OAuth authentication with CDF.
- Option to fetch only the latest data point for the time series.

## 2.1.1 - November 23, 2020

### Bug fixes:
- Support variables in `time series by asset` query.
In version 2.1.0 `$variable` used as an `Asset tag` worked for earlier created dashboards, but it was impossible to create a new panel with the same capability.


## 2.1.0 - November 19, 2020

* The data source requires Grafana version `7.0.6` or above.
* Time series are now saved to dashboards by their `externalId` where possible.
This allows you to switch between CDF projects that contain time series with matching `externalIds`.
* Support for [synthetic time series alignment](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/concepts/resource_types/synthetic_timeseries.html#alignment).
* Rewrote data source GUI to React.
* Updated CDF logo to match light/dark theme.

## 2.0.1 - August 25, 2020
### Bug fixes:
- **\[Custom query\]** Option to display legend label as a plain text instead of expression

  Example for query: `ts{id=1} + ts{id=2} + 1`:

  * User label `custom name` results in `custom name` label. (No specific timeseries referenced in the label)
  * User label `{{name}}` results in `timeseries_name_1 + timeseries_name_2 + 1` label. (This works the same way as before)
- **\[Custom query\]** Improved error handling
  * HTTP 500 errors messages are visible from the GUI
- **\[Custom query\]** Default granularity falls back to 1 second if shorter value is provided 
  * Previously, selecting a time span less than 10 minutes resulted in a HTTP 400 error.

 
## 2.0.0 - June 29, 2020

### General improvements

- A new query language inspired by PromQL and compatible with synthetic time series in CDF. [Learn more](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/dashboards/guides/grafana/timeseries.html#custom-queries).
- Support for all filtering capabilities available in [CDF API v1](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/) for the respective resource types (assets, events, times series).
- Any future **filtering** capabilities added to CDF API v1 will be **automatically supported** by the data source (filters are passed directly to CDF).
- Query expressions resulting in errors now **displays error messages** in the UI.
- Regular expressions filtering can be used as part of the **Query** expression. The **Filter** field has been removed.
- Supports CDF [API v1](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/API_versioning.html#current-api-versions), with no dependency to older API versions.
- [New documentation section](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/dashboards/guides/grafana/getting_started.html) for the connector, covering installation and administration, upgrades, feature documentation and getting started information.
- Compatibility with Grafana 7.0. Learn more about the new capabilities [here](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/05/18/grafana-v7.0-released-new-plugin-architecture-visualizations-transformations-native-trace-support-and-more/?isource=hp).

### Time series and custom queries

- You can now access time series that don't have the `legacyName` attribute populated with the data source.
- Setting `Root Asset` in the **Custom query** tab is no longer required. This filter has been removed from the UI and is now available as part of a custom query expression. For example: `ts{rootAssetIds=[12335453, 3455566]}`.
- Custom query aggregation requests are less likely to trigger rate limiting in CDF API.
- Functions:
  - Support for **string time series** through the new `map` function allows you to convert string values to numeric values which can then be plotted by Grafana. For example: `map(ts{externalId='pump_29'}, ['OPEN', 'CLOSED'], [1, 0], -1)`.
  - Use the `on_error` function to gain control over query calculations resolving with errors, such as division by 0. The function allows you to set a default value for individual data points that resolved with errors. Without the `on_error` function, the chart shows empty space in those places. Example: `on_error(1/ts{externalId='canBeZero'}, 0)`.
  - Variable length functions: `max(x1, x2, ...)`, `min(...)`, `avg(...)`.
  - The `power` function has been renamed to `pow`.
  - These functions are no longer supported: `acos`, `asin`, `atan`, `ceil`, `celing`, `cot`, `degrees`, `floor`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `radians`, `sign`, `tan`, `atan2`, `mod`, `truncate`, `rand`, `crc32`, `conv`, `div`.
- These aggregates are no longer supported by custom queries: `max`, `min`, `count`, `sum`, `continuousVariance`, `discreteVariance`, `totalVariation`.
- Short names for aggregation functions are no longer supported. Use full names instead: `average`, `interpolation`, `stepInterpolation`.
- The `timeseries{options}` function has been renamed to `ts{options}`.
- Filtering:
  - New options:`isString=false`, `externalId='my_id'`, `id=123`, `externalIdPrefix='my_'`
  - Relate to asset tree with: `assetSubtreeIds=[{id=754173880412890},{externalId="23-TE-96148"}]`, `assetIds=[123, 234]`, `assetExternalIds=['pump_1', 'pump_2']`, `rootAssetIds=[123, 234]`
  - New range filters for create and updated time: `createdTime={min=0, max= 1593018651}`, `lastUpdatedTime={min=1493018651, max= 1593018651}`
  - Select time series based on dataSet membership: `dataSetIds=[{externalId='Prediction Model A'},{id=123}]`
  - `path` is no longer supported
  - See the full list of [supported filters](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/listTimeSeries) for the `ts{}` expression.

### Annotations

- New filters: `assetExternalIds`, `rootAssetIds`, `dataSetIds`, `externalIdPrefix`, `source`.
- Find active events in range with the `activeAtTime` filter. If `endTime` is null, the event is active from `startTime` onwards. The `activeAtTime` filter will match all events that are active at some point from `min` to `max`. Example: `activeAtTime={min=1591018651, max= 1593018651}`.
- `description` supports only regular expression operators `=~`, `!~`, and `!=`.
- `minStartTime`/`maxStartTime` has been replaced by the `startTime={min=0, max= 1593018651}` filter.
- `minEndTime`/`maxEndTime` has been replaced by the `endTime={min=0, max= 1593018651}` filter, enabling you to also filter for events without the `endTime` set: `endTime={isNull=true}`.
- `minCreatedTime`/`maxCreatedTime` has been replaced by the `createdTime={min=0, max= 1593018651}` filter.
- `minLastUpdatedTime`/`maxLastUpdatedTime` has been replaced by the `lastUpdatedTime={min=0, max= 1593018651}` filter.
- `assetSubtrees` has been replaced by the `assetSubtreeIds=[{id=754173880412890},{externalId="23-TE-96148"}]` filter which introduces support for `Id`/`ExternalId` input.
- These filters are no longer supported: `sort`, `dir`, `limit`, `offset`, `sourceId`.
- See the full list of [supported filters](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/advancedListEvents) for the `events{}` expression.

### Templating

- New filters: `parentIds`, `parentExternalIds`, `rootIds`, `dataSetIds`, `externalIdPrefix`, `root`.
- The `description` field supports only regular expression operators `=~`, `!~`, and `!=`.
- Select assets based on **label**: `labels={contains={externalId="pump"}}`, `labels={containsAny=[{externalId="pump_type_A"},{externalId="pump_type_B"}]}`, `labels={containsAll=[{externalId="pump"},{externalId="rust_detected"}]}`
- `assetSubtrees` replaced by the `assetSubtreeIds=[{id=754173880412890},{externalId="23-TE-96148"}]` filter which introduces support for `Id`/`ExternalId` inputs.
- `minCreatedTime`/`maxCreatedTime` has been replaced by the `createdTime={min=0, max= 1593018651}` filter.
- `minLastUpdatedTime`/`maxLastUpdatedTime` has been replaced by the `lastUpdatedTime={min=1592222651, max= 1593018651}` filters.
- These options are no longer supported: `query`, `sort`, `dir`, `offset`, `boostname`, `path`, `depth`, `sourceId`.
- See the full list of [supported filters](https://docs.cognite.com/api/v1/#operation/listAssets) for the `assets{}` expression.
